# Sigmastar SSW101b driver

This is code dump of the SSW101b wifi driver found in an SDK
that was released to github and then deleted.

This code is GPLv2 (includes parts of the Linux kernel and is
directly based on a driver in the kernel) but up until now
seems to have been distributed as a pre-compiled .ko module
without code.
